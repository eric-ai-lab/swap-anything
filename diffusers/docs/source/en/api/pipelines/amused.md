# aMUSEd

Amused is a lightweight text to image model based off of the [muse](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00704.pdf) architecture. Amused is particularly useful in applications that require a lightweight and fast model such as generating many images quickly at once.

Amused is a vqvae token based transformer that can generate an image in fewer forward passes than many diffusion models. In contrast with muse, it uses the smaller text encoder CLIP-L/14 instead of t5-xxl. Due to its small parameter count and few forward pass generation process, amused can generate many images quickly. This benefit is seen particularly at larger batch sizes.
